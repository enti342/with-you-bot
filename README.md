# with-you-bot
An overengineered counter that allows for our controllers to track the "with you" check ins on frequency, as well as the times they have been overstressed while controlling.

This is a Python Discord bot. It was made in Python 3.8 with the Discord class. It also features a database connection (using MySQL) for tracking how many times a specific user has used the commands.
